In supermarket.php there are accesskey instructions.
This allows the browser to launch buttons automatically
I have created an invisible button and attached an event to it, which copies the total due to clipboard
Alt_Ctrl_d is the accesskey
Autokey fires the Alt_Ctrl_d, which then fires the copy to clipboard.
